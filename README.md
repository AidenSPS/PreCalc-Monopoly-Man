# PreCalc-Monopoly-Man

Hello and welcome to my README file for the PreCalc LT1 Project, I hope this found you well (Especially the ones who judge and grade this). 

First and formost, I have inputed my mathematical functions onto desmos.com for cleaner, clearer, and more refined graphs (because my graph drawing is horrendous). 

Second, this was inspired by Monopoly the game so all credit goes to Hasbro.INC and the original inventors, Lizzie Magie and Charles Darrow for creating the board game and Hasbro to publish the game to the public. 

Third, I did have many doubts as to what I wanted to do, at first it was a comic book, then a short story, then I decided to stick with the short story, but pull my own twist on it. Why not hit a throwback to what I did last year and make a page about it. 

Lastly, I wanted to make a disclaimer about the content of the page and all of the images ARE SCHOOL APPROPRIATE and at are all screenshots of images (So I own the screenshot, but the content of the screenshot will be sourced here). All of the sources will be listed in the README.md file. This will be made known during the presentation. I will link my github page at the end and so that people can discover/explore different sources and for citation reasons to avoid plagarism of any kind, sources will be here.
